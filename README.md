# Guidelines
## Autonomy
We require suppliers to be autonomous in their work. The turnaround time for questions could be significant (sometimes days) depending on workload and priorities. It is thus important for suppliers to try to find answers themselves, starting by searching this guide.
## Confidentiality
All the work we do should be considered highly confidential. 
## Speed
Speed is a constant requirement. The faster a task can be executed, the better.
